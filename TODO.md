- **1. Re-brand and Generalize the Project**

  - The repository is stripped of all "Terracotta RPG" branding and repurposed as a generic authentication template.

  - A new, memorable name for the template is chosen (e.g., `Next-Auth Fortress`).

  - All user-facing text and UI components (e.g., in `LoginPage.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `layout.tsx`) are updated to reflect the new, generic branding.

  - The existing `docs` content (`1-value-proposition-canvas.md`, `2-ideal-customer-profile.md`) is removed or archived, as it is specific to the old project.

- **2. Overhaul the `README.md` for Discovery and Marketing**

  - A comprehensive `README.md` that serves as the primary landing page for the template.

  - A "Features" section clearly lists the implemented authentication methods (Google OAuth, Magic Links, WebAuthn/Passkeys) and the core tech stack (Next.js, Drizzle, Chakra UI, Iron Session, etc.).

  - A "Live Demo" link and screenshots/GIFs of the login and registration flow are included.

  - A prominent "Created By" section attributes the work to you, with links to `avisantoso.com` and `verticalai.com.au`.

- **3. Streamline Deployment and Configuration**

  - The `README.md` includes "Deploy to Vercel" and/or "Deploy to Netlify" buttons for one-click setup.

  - A `.env.example` file is created, listing and documenting all necessary environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RPID`, etc.).

  - The Drizzle schema and setup scripts are confirmed to work seamlessly for a new user deploying the project for the first time.

- **4. Refine the Codebase for Readability and Extensibility**

  - Add extensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments to all server actions (`/src/actions`), services (`/src/lib/services`), and complex utility functions, explaining their purpose and parameters.

  - The file structure is clean and intuitive, with any unused files (e.g., pages related only to "Terracotta RPG") removed.

  - Authentication flows are clearly separated and easy to trace, from the UI component to the server action and database interaction.

- **5. Enhance the Post-Login User Experience**

  - The default page after login (`/src/app/page.tsx`) is transformed from a `UserDetailsPage` into a simple dashboard.

  - The dashboard clearly displays the user's email, their authentication status, and presents context-aware actions. For example, it prominently features the `AddPasskeyButton` if the user has not yet registered a passkey.

  - The `RegisterPage` for passkeys is confirmed to be skippable and can be accessed later from the user dashboard, making the initial sign-up flow faster.

- **6. Create Clear, Actionable Documentation**

  - A new `/docs` or `/guides` directory is created with concise Markdown files.

  - Guides exist for setting up API keys and OAuth credentials for each service (Google, Resend).

  - An "Architecture Overview" guide explains how the key pieces (Next.js Server Actions, Drizzle, Iron Session) work together.

  - A "How to Customize" guide provides steps for adding new authentication providers or modifying the UI.

- **7. Integrate Strategic Marketing and Attribution**

  - The `Footer.tsx` is retained, providing persistent, non-intrusive links to your personal and business websites.

  - The `README.md`, license file, and documentation headers contain clear attribution.

  - The HTML for the magic link email (`sendMagicLink.ts`) retains the branded footer, showcasing your work to every new end-user who signs up via email.
